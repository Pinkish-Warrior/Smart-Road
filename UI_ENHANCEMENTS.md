- **Realistic windows:**
  - Dark glass with blue tint (RGB: 40, 50, 70)
  - Reflection highlights (semi-transparent white)
  - Front and rear windows
- **Enhanced headlights:**
  - Glow effect (yellow halo)
  - Bright white center
  - Proportional sizing
- **Tail lights** (red, at rear)
- **Side mirrors** (darker body color, positioned on sides)
- **Better proportions:**
  - Body: 50% width, 87.5% height
  - Windows: 37.5% width, 15% height
  - Lights: 15% width, 8% height
  - Mirrors: 8% width, 10% height

### 5. Enhanced Help Display
**Location:** `src/sim.rs` - `draw_help_overlay()` function

**Features:**
- **Large, clear modal** (500x440px)
- **Title bar** with gradient and "CONTROLS" text
- **Glowing border** (4px thick, blue)
- **8 control descriptions:**
  1. ↑ Arrow Up - Spawn Red car from SOUTH
  2. ↓ Arrow Down - Spawn Green car from NORTH
  3. ← Arrow Left - Spawn Yellow car from EAST
  4. → Arrow Right - Spawn Blue car from WEST
  5. R - RANDOM MODE (continuous spawn)

- **Error handling**: Proper Result/Option usage
- **Documentation**: Clear comments explaining algorithms

## Future Enhancement Ideas

4. **Configurable Settings** - JSON config for speeds, distances, colors
5. **Replay System** - Save/load traffic patterns
6. **Heatmap Visualization** - Show congestion zones
7. **Lane Route Indicators** - Visual R/S/L markers on lanes
8. **Multiple Intersection Types** - T-junctions, roundabouts

## Files Modified
1. `src/sim.rs` - Main game loop, rendering, HUD, help overlay
2. `src/cars.rs` - Vehicle physics, animation, statistics
3. `src/textures.rs` - Procedural texture generation
4. `Cargo.toml` - Dependencies (unchanged)

## Dependencies
- `sdl2 = "0.37.0"` - Graphics and input
- `rand = "0.8.5"` - Random generation
- `image = "0.25.5"` - Image loading (for potential assets)
- `druid = "0.8.3"` - Statistics window UI

## Conclusion

The Smart Road simulator now features a comprehensive, visually appealing, and informative UI/UX that meets all requirements of the Rust Piscine project while providing an enhanced user experience through smooth animations, detailed statistics tracking, and clear visual feedback.

All enhancements are procedurally generated (no external assets required), maintaining the self-contained nature of the application while significantly improving visual quality and user understanding.
